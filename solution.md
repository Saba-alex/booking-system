# Solution Documentation

## How the Solution Works

This project implements a **booking system** backend using **Node.js**, **Express**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**. The core components are:

- Events: Manage events where users can book seats.
- Seats: Each event has multiple seats, which can be available, reserved, or booked.
- Customers: Users who book seats and place orders.
- Reservations: Temporary holds on seats for customers until they confirm or the hold expires.
- Orders: Finalized bookings linked to reservations, indicating paid status.

### Key Features:

- Atomic Seat Reservation: Using MongoDB sessions and transactions, the system locks seats during reservation to prevent double booking.
- Expiration of Reservations: Reserved seats are automatically freed after a configurable timeout if not confirmed.
- Order Creation: On confirmation, orders are created, seats are booked, and reservations updated.


## How It Solves the Problem

The main challenge is avoiding double booking and managing seat availability in a concurrent environment. This solution:

- Uses MongoDB transactions to atomically lock and confirm seats.
- Validates seat status on every action to ensure integrity.
- Handles edge cases such as expired reservations and invalid requests.

## Real-World Usage

In a real-world ticketing or event booking system, this backend can:

- Handle multiple customers trying to book seats simultaneously without conflicts.
- Automatically release reserved seats when users do not confirm within the time limit.
- Integrate with payment systems by updating order status after payment.
- Serve as the backend for web or mobile clients managing events, customers, seats, reservations, and orders.

This solution provides a solid foundation that can be extended with features like user authentication, payment gateways, notifications, and analytics for a complete event booking platform.
